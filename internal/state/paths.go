// path rule. In particular WarnPath is a cross-boundary contract — the server
// WRITES the file (WriteWarn) and the TUI READS it via fleetpaths.WarnPath —
// so the two sides must derive it from the same definition or the post-create
// warning banner silently stops surfacing.

// BuildkitDir returns the per-fleet host directory that holds the shared
